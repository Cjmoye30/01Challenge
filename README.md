# Challenge 01 - HTML & CSS Code Refactor

## Description

### What was your motivation?

* The purpose is to refactor existing code to attain better **Accessibility Standards**. Better accessibility allows the webpage to appear higher within the search for users looking for content related to this webpage. This code mainly replaces existing div containers with their appropriate **Semantic Elements**, ensures all images include some alternative text in case a user relies on a screen reader, reorganizes the HTML flow independent of how it is displayed on the webpage and consolidates the CSS. And lastly, the purpose is to consider how another developer can look through the code for any possible debugging.

### Why did you build this project?
* I built this project to understand the common HTML semantic elements and how their normal flow withinn the code should look. Part of the assignment was to adhere to the **Scout Rule** - meaning leaving the code cleaner and more consolidated versus when we started.


### What problem does it solve?
* This code refactor eliminated possible accessibility issues users with disabilities could have when viewing this webpage. Webpages will rank higher in the search results when accessibility standards are adhered.

### What did you learn?
* Proper use of semantic elements - HTML, body, main, aside, section, etc.
* The flow of the HTML code is independent of how it appears on the page - ex. The semantic element **Aside** should be near the top of the HTML code although it may be off to the right side of the page.
* *The Scout Rule* - means we leave the code cleaner than we found it.
* Always keep in mind how another developer can read and interpret your code.
* CSS consolidation - looking for ways to condense the CSS so there are not so many repeatable lines.
