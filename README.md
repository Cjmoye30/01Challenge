# Challenge 01 - HTML & CSS Code Refactor

## Description

### What was your motivation?

* The purpose of this code refactor was to take existing code which works and behaves fine to the end user, and refactor the HTML/CSS code to better meet **Accessibility Standards**. Better accessibility allows the webpage to appear higher within the search for users looking for content that relates to the webpage. This code mainly replaces existing div containers with their appropriate **Semantic Elements**, ensures all images include some alternative text in case a user relys on a screenreader, reorganizing the HTML flow independent of how it is dispaled on the webpage, and consolidating the CSS. Amd lastly, it was important to consider how easily another developer can read the code if they had to come in and debug.

### Why did you build this project?
* I built this project to gain a better understanding of the common HTML semantic elements and what their normal flow on the page should look like. Part of the assignment was to adhering to the **Scout Rule** - which means leaving the code cleaner and more consolidated vesus when we started


### What problem does it solve?
* This code refactor eliminates possible accessibility issues users with disabilities could have when viewing this webpage. Webpages will rank higher in the search results when accessibility standards are followed

### What did you learn?
* Proper use of semantic elements - HTML, body, main, aside, section, etc.
* The flow of the HTML code is independent of how it appears on the page - ex. The semantic element **Aside** should be near the top of the HTML code although it may be off to the right side of the page.
* *The Scout Rule* - means we leave the code cleaner than we found it.
* Always keep in mind how another developer can read and interpret your code
* CSS consolidation - looking for ways to condense the CSS so there are not so many repeatable lines
